# Amazon-Web-Scraper

Web scraping is an automated method used to extract large amounts of data from websites. In this project I tried to extract some paramerters (Product Name & Rating) from a page of Amazon.

To extract data using web scraping with python, I followed these basic steps:

- Find the URL that you want to scrape
- Inspecting the Page
- Find the data you want to extract
- Write the code
- Run the code and extract the data
- Store the data in the required format
